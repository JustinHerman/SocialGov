##  **Emergency Use**
In the event of an emergency, social media tools should be utilized in accordance with the Emergency Public Affairs Plan, which calls for a coordinated messaging effort between the Headquarters Office of Public Affairs and any programs, sites or facilities that may be involved: "When Department of Energy headquarters or a DOE site/facility declares an emergency, it is expected to meet the public information obligations of the Department of Energy orders, guidance and requirements and the comprehensive emergency management plans developed by each site.”

This guidance and requirement includes the timely provision of media informational materials to the Public Affairs staff at Department headquarters. Every effort should be made by the designated public affairs officers at the site level to consult with the Headquarters Public Affairs Office on the initial dissemination of information to the public and media.

From the DOE O 151.1C "Comprehensive Emergency Management System":

"Initial news releases or public statements must be approved by the Cognizant Field Element official responsible for emergency public information review and dissemination. Following initial news releases and public statements, updates must be coordinated with the DOE/NNSA  (as appropriate) Director of Public Affairs and the Headquarters Emergency Manager."

For more information on emergency communication protocols, reference the Emergency Public Affairs Plan or contact your public affairs representative.

## Standards of Conduct/Rules of Behavior
Wanted to raise a concern about individuals creating a "page" as opposed to a "profile" on Facebook to comment frequently on a federally managed page.  This creates a firewall in a sense, where they cannot not be removed by Facebook.  Often times, users can report a "profile" for harrassing behavior and Facebook will intervene.  Some frequently disciplined profiles then opt to create a "page".  Would it be appropriate to "ban Facebook pages, and only allow for individuals (profiles) to comment"?
