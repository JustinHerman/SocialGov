## Direct visitors to an official site
Providing a link to an official .gov, .mil, or .us website provides readers with a way to get detailed information if needed. In addition, by using a URL shortener such as ([go.usa.gov](go.usa.gov)), links can double as verification that they're about to visit a safe and official website containing authoritative information.

## Disclaimers should be used

## Don't discuss info not already public (Info on SM also must be elsewhere on web)

##  **Emergency Use**
In the event of an emergency, social media tools should be utilized in accordance with the Emergency Public Affairs Plan, which calls for a coordinated messaging effort between the Headquarters Office of Public Affairs and any programs, sites or facilities that may be involved: "When Department of Energy headquarters or a DOE site/facility declares an emergency, it is expected to meet the public information obligations of the Department of Energy orders, guidance and requirements and the comprehensive emergency management plans developed by each site.”

This guidance and requirement includes the timely provision of media informational materials to the Public Affairs staff at Department headquarters. Every effort should be made by the designated public affairs officers at the site level to consult with the Headquarters Public Affairs Office on the initial dissemination of information to the public and media.

From the DOE O 151.1C "Comprehensive Emergency Management System":

"Initial news releases or public statements must be approved by the Cognizant Field Element official responsible for emergency public information review and dissemination. Following initial news releases and public statements, updates must be coordinated with the DOE/NNSA  (as appropriate) Director of Public Affairs and the Headquarters Emergency Manager."

For more information on emergency communication protocols, reference the Emergency Public Affairs Plan or contact your public affairs representative.

The one issue that stands out to me as one for further discussion is "no political" - this may be an area where there are differing levels of engagement by agency.  I reached out to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, Hatch Act Unit and received the following information: "The advice that we give with respect to this issue and the Hatch Act is that the agency does not have any responsibility to remove political postings on its social media pages.  However, if it decides to do so, it must remove all political postings and not pick and choose which ones can stay and which ones must be removed.  So, basically, the advice is either remove all or do nothing – either all the political postings stay or all of them go."  I would opt to let members of the public voice the political support/dissent.  Because in my community, without letting this through, it would be a heavily moderated page, and sort of squimish around the 1st Amendment.

## No requests to contact Congress/officials or lobbying

## No surveys/polls/questionnaires

## Only use official email
Official government social media accounts should use a government-owned email address for sign up. The government email indicates that the account is being used in conjunction with an official Agency effort. If possible, account should use an email which leads to a shared/group inbox. If using an employee email address there's the possibility that the account will no longer be able to be managed if the employees leaves their Agency. 

Using a personal email address is discouraged since accountability of the account, along with correspondence sent to that personal email address, can present legal, ethical, and records challenges for the Agency.
